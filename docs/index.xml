      <description>About Us As sisters, we&amp;rsquo;ve had the honor of being surrounded by amazing home cooks, so great tasting food has always been a staple for us. Food is very often tied to folk&amp;rsquo;s best memories with family and friends. So we want to share our knowledge of the Jamaican cuisine as a way to preserve our childhood memories, and to create new memories for others.
