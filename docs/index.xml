      <description>Photo Album June 19th: Nibble Kitchen Popup on Juneteenth Many THANKS to everyone that dropped into the popup at Nibble Kitchen in Bow Market to enjoy a hot patty, side of plaintains and sorrel refresher. Going in we were unsure of how many diners would come out on a Monday afternoon. However we were pleasantly suprised and promise to have more at our next popup.
