#### `{{<icon class="fa fa-info fa-lg">}}` About Us

As sisters, we've had the honor of being surrounded by amazing home cooks, so great tasting food has always been a staple for us. Food is very often tied to folk's best memories with family and friends. So we want to share our knowledge of the Jamaican cuisine as a way to preserve our childhood memories, and to create new memories for others.
