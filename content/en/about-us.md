###### Globally Inspired, Locally Rooted

We’re a sister duo with cooking and baking deeply rooted in our lives. Growing up, our mom and aunties would whip up delicious Jamaican dishes, especially the national dish, ackee and saltfish (cod) with dumplings. We didn’t get to enjoy traditional Jamaican meals every day, so when they were served, they felt special and unique.

Some of our favorite dishes include brown stew chicken, curry goat, and oxtails, often paired with a side of mixed vegetables and rice and peas infused with coconut milk, giving the rice its signature blush.

One of our aunties was a chef and restaurant owner near Fort Lauderdale, Florida, for several years. We had the opportunity to learn by watching her showcase her Jamaican culinary skills. She introduced us to more complex dishes like jerk chicken with festival, escovitch fish (red snapper) with bammy, and the iconic Jamaican black cake.

Now we’re excited to share the rich flavors and vibrant culinary traditions of Jamaica with food lovers across Massachusetts. It all starts with you selecting a package of our patties and popping them into the oven. Then, sit back and let your taste buds escape to the sunny shores as we celebrate Jamaican culture and our love of home-cooked island food.
