*Thatâ€™s how we say hello in Jamaican Patois.*

We are so glad that you have arrived at **Cocobelly Bites**, where we share the food and flavors we grew up on.

This is the place to grab some bites and reconnect through conversation, culture, and good vibes. Every flavor tells a story, and every bite brings us closer to the island of Jamaica.

So go ahead and let your belly rule your mind. *Ya mon!*

Learn a little more [about us](about-us).
