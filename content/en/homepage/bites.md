We take pride in crafting handmade, delicious Jamaican bites. Our mission is to bring those bold island flavors to Somerville and beyond, one patty at a time.


##### *Our Bites*

**Jamaican Patty**
A savory pastry traditionally filled with seasoned ground beef. Its golden color comes from curry and turmeric, which also give it a rich, distinct flavor.
Today, Jamaican patties come with all kinds of fillings, from curry chicken to ackee, and even lobster.

The most popular way to eat a patty in Jamaica is tucked inside cocobread, soft and slightly sweet bread that turns the patty into a satisfying sandwich.

Get ready to bite into our homemade, flaky patties packed with love and spice.

See the [menu page](menu) for more details.
