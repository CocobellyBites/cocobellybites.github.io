We take pride in making handmade and delicious Jamaican bites and our mission is to bring these bites to Somerville and beyond.


##### *Our Bites*

**Jamaican Patty**
A flavorful pastry that is traditional filled with ground beef. The pastry color emerges from the curry/turmeric spices which also lends to it's distinct taste. Today you can find the Jamaican patty with various fillings from curry chicken, ackee and even lobster. The most common way Jamaicans eat their patty is tucked into a cocobread, basically like a sandwich. Get ready to bite into our homemade flaky patties.
